This README describes the BGPmon Archiver.

DESCRIPTION
------------

The BGPmon Archiver will connect to a BGPmon instance and write the XML output
to disk, one message per line. Messages are organized according to the peer
address. Depending on the options specified, the XML message is translated to a
pipe ('|') delimited format, similar to the one produced by libbgpdump.

INSTALLATION
-------------

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

Copy the sample configuration file from the etc/ directory and put it in a
standard location. Change the paths specified by the 'directory' and
'peerdirectory' parameters to the appropriate paths for your setup.

If you want to control the archiver via the system's init processes, copy the
bgpmon-archiver script from the scripts/ directory to /etc/init.d.  This script
expects that the archiver process will be run by user 'bgpmon'.  If you plan to
use a different user to run the archiver, edit this script and change '--user
bgpmon' to the user you would like to use.

Next, make the script executable:

chmod +x /etc/init.d/bgpmon-archiver

If you would like the archiver to start up automatically each time the machine
restarts/reboots, do the following:

On Ubuntu:
update-rc.d bgpmon-archiver defaults

On Fedora:
chkconfig --level 12345 bgpmon-archiver on
