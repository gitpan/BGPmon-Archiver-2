1. Add validator to check if bgpmon data is sane.
2. Archive per collector.
3. Output in bgpdump's format.


If collector connection fails:
in XML File
<ARCHIVER><TIME> </TIME> <EVENT cause="hello"> STOPPED <CAUSE> </CAUSE> </ARCHIVER>
in BGPdump File
ARCHIVER|TIMESTAMP|STOPPED|lostconnection
(would be last line of a file where archiver stopped for any reason)

when collector starts and file is not at start of interval:
in XML File
<ARCHIVER><TIME> </TIME> <EVENT> STARTED </EVENT> </ARCHIVER>
in BGPdump File
ARCHIVER|TIMESTAMP|STARTED|reconnected/started 
(would be first line of a file where archiver started/restarted for any reason)


STATUS program:

on detecting down,   

1) identify all files open at time of crash
2) check last line of each file for ARCHIVER|TS|STOPPED
3) add ARCHIVER|TS|CRASHED
